### Lesson 1: Introduction to Python Syntax and Control Structures

#### Overview
In this lesson, we'll combine an introduction to Python's basic syntax with an exploration of its control structures. We'll cover variables, data types, indentation, as well as conditional statements and loops.

#### Topics Covered
- Variables and Data Types ([Python Data Types](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator))
- Indentation ([Python Indentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_indentation.asp))
- Conditional Statements ([Python If Statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements))
- Loops ([Python For and While Loops](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements))

#### Programming Assignment
Write a Python script that takes user input for their name and age, uses conditional statements to check if the age is over 18, and then prints out an appropriate greeting based on the age.

### Lesson 2: Functions and Modules in Python

#### Overview
We'll focus on defining functions and using Python modules to organize code.

#### Topics Covered
- Defining Functions ([Python Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions))
- Python Modules ([Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html))

#### Programming Assignment
Create a Python module containing functions for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and a main script that imports and uses them.

---

### Lesson 3: Pythonic Code

#### Overview
This lesson introduces idiomatic Python practices, such as list comprehensions and lambda functions.

#### Topics Covered
- List Comprehensions ([Python List Comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions))
- Lambda Functions ([Python Lambda Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions))

#### Programming Assignment
Write a Python script to filter even numbers from a list using list comprehensions and lambda functions.

---

### Lesson 4: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python

#### Overview
We'll dive into Object-Oriented Programming in Python by learning how to create classes and objects.

#### Topics Covered
- Classes and Objects ([Python Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html))
- Inheritance ([Python Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance))

#### Programming Assignment
Create a Python class for a simple bank account with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and displaying balance.

---

### Lesson 5: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in Python

#### Overview
We'll explore advanced features of Python's object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstract classes.

#### Topics Covered
- Encapsulation ([Python Encapsulation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables))
- Polymorphism ([Python Polymorphism](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_polymorphism.asp))
- Abstract Classes ([Python Abstract Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html))

#### Programming Assignment
Extend your bank account class to include different types of accounts (e.g., Savings and Checking) utilizing inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

### Lesson 6: Introduction to JavaScript Syntax and Control Structures

#### Overview
In this combined lesson, we'll introduce JavaScript's basic syntax, including variables and data types, and delve into control structures like conditional statements and loops.

#### Topics Covered
- Variables and Data Types ([JavaScript Data Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures))
- Conditional Statements ([JavaScript If Statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else))
- Loops ([JavaScript Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration))

#### Programming Assignment
Write a JavaScript script that takes user input for their name and age, uses conditional statements to check if the age is over 18, and then displays an appropriate greeting on the console based on the age.

---

### Lesson 7: Functions and Scoping in JavaScript

#### Overview
This lesson focuses on defining functions and understanding variable scope in JavaScript.

#### Topics Covered
- Functions ([JavaScript Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions))
- Variable Scope ([JavaScript Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variable_scope))

#### Programming Assignment
Create a JavaScript function that reverses a string and another that filters out even numbers from an array.

---

### Lesson 8: JavaScript and the DOM

#### Overview
We will introduce HTML and explore JavaScript's ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).

#### Topics Covered
- Basic HTML ([HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element))
- DOM Manipulation ([JavaScript DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction))

#### Programming Assignment
Create a simple HTML page with a JavaScript function that changes the text of a paragraph element when a button is clicked.

---

### Lesson 9: Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript

#### Overview
This lesson introduces asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript, like callbacks, promises, and async/await.

#### Topics Covered
- Callbacks ([JavaScript Callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function))
- Promises and Async/Await ([JavaScript Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise))

#### Programming Assignment
Create a JavaScript function that fetches random jokes from an API and displays them on an HTML page using async/await.

---

### Lesson 10: JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries

#### Overview
This lesson provides an overview of popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and jQuery.

#### Topics Covered
