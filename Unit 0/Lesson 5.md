## Encapsulation
- **Definition**: Encapsulation refers to the practice of keeping the internal details of an object hidden from the outside world and only exposing what's necessary.

- **Private Attributes and Methods**: Prefix with **two underscores** `__`. These are strictly confined to the class and can't be accessed outside of it. However, they can be accessed using name mangling: `_classname__attribute`.

- **Protected Attributes and Methods**: Prefix with **a single underscore** `_`. This is more of a convention than strict encapsulation. They can still be accessed outside the class, but the single underscore indicates that they should be treated as "protected" and not be accessed directly.

**Code Example**:

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius  # protected attribute
        self.__pi = 3.14       # private attribute

    def get_area(self):
        return self.__pi * self._radius * self._radius

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.get_area())  # Accessible
# print(circle.__pi)     # This will cause an error since __pi is private
print(circle._Circle__pi)  # Accessing private attribute using name mangling
```

## Polymorphism
- **Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It signifies the ability of one function/method to work in various ways based on the object it's acting upon.

- **Duck Typing**: The term "Duck Typing" comes from the phrase: "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck." In programming, this means if an object behaves in a certain way (has a certain method or attribute), we assume it's of a certain type.

**Code Example (Duck Typing)**:

```python
class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.sound()

d = Dog()
c = Cat()

print(animal_sound(d))  # Outputs: Woof!
print(animal_sound(c))  # Outputs: Meow!
```

- **Method Overriding**: When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already provided by its parent class, this is called method overriding.

**Code Example (Method Overriding)**:

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

d = Dog()
print(d.sound())  # Outputs: Woof! (because of overriding)
```

## Abstract Classes and the `abc` Module
- **Definition**: An abstract class serves as a blueprint for other classes and can't be instantiated.

- **`abc` Module**: Python provides the `abc` module to work with abstract classes.

- **Abstract Base Class (ABC)**: An ABC is a kind of abstract class that cannot be instantiated and acts as a foundational base for other classes.

**Code Example**:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

    # Concrete method
    def display(self):
        print(f"Area: {self.area()}, Perimeter: {self.perimeter()}")

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius

c = Circle(5)
c.display()  # Outputs: Area: 78.5, Perimeter: 31.4
```

## Homework Assignment

Create a `Bank` class that manages multiple `BankAccount`s (both Savings and Checking). The class should be able to:

1. Add new accounts.
2. Delete accounts.
3. Deposit to a specific account.
4. Withdraw from a specific account.
5. Apply interest to all savings accounts.
6. Fetch the total balance of the bank (sum of all accounts).

Note: Utilize the concepts of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance in your solution.
