# Welcome to Advanced Topics in Computer Science
This is a level 3 / "capstone" course in computer science. After completing this
course, students will have mastered the fundamentals of coding as an art and science,
understand the principles of application development and team collaboration, and be
confident in their ability to adapt to new and emergent technologies.

## 2023 Overview

The theme for this course rotates on an anual basis. For the 2023 - 24 academic year,
that theme will be "Internet Technologies." We will cover the basics of coding for and
with the web. Students will learn how to build applications capable of communicating
with other services over the internet and harness external APIs to develop their own
applications. The year will culminate in a large capstone project in which students
will design and build their own web application.

## Unit Outline
