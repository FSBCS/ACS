# Welcome to Advanced Topics in Computer Science
This is a level 3 / "capstone" course in computer science. After completing this
course, students will have mastered the fundamentals of coding as an art and science,
understand the principles of application development and team collaboration, and be
confident in their ability to adapt to new and emergent technologies. For more
information on CS curriculum at Friends, please see the [department's website](https://quakerlabs.org).

## 2023 Overview

The theme for this course rotates on an anual basis. For the 2023 - 24 academic year,
that theme will be "Internet Technologies." We will cover the basics of coding for and
with the web. Students will learn how to build applications capable of communicating
with other services over the internet and harness external APIs to develop their own
applications. The year will culminate in a large capstone project in which students
will design and build their own web application.

## Unit Outline

### Unit 0: Python and JS Crash Course
In this unit, students will gain an intuitive understanding of the Python and JavaScript
languages and become comfortable using them to build increasingly complex applications.
 
### Unit 1: HTTP and OAuth2
We will cover the basics of the HTTP protocol, with a focus on the request methods for
CRUD operations. We will use these operations to interact with some simple APIs.
Subsequently, students will look at more sophisticated APIs requiring API keys and ultimately
the OAUth2 protocol. In this final step, students will learn how to navigate authentication
and authorization control flows by hand and strategies for integrating them into web applications.

### Unit 3: Voice Assistant Project
This unit consists entirely of a project conducted in pairs to build a voice assistant with a
Raspberry Pi that can interact with the Google API (using the device authorization flow) and
perform basic operations on the user's behalf (such as sending or reading email).

### Unit 4: Building a RESTful API
We will examine API interactions from the reverse side: that of the API developer. This unit
will summarize much of the previous course work using the Symfony framework. A crash course in
PHP and SQL will also be included. Students will develop both an authorization and resource
server enabling them to provide user data securely over the web.

### Unit 5: Capstone Project
In this final unit, students will work to design, develop, and test a working prototype of a
web application of their own invention. Students will work in partners to incorporate all of
their learning throughout the course. These projects will be displayed at the end-of-year
showcase for members of the Friends community outside of the class.

## Required Resources
There is no textbook required for this course. However, there are several online resources
which we will make use of throughout the year. These will be posted in the relevant unit
folders in this repository. Students will however need a computer at home on which they
can install and run a variety of development software. If a student does not have access
to this, please let the instructor know and we'll work something out.

## AI Statement
Generative AI has become a major resource for developers accross the board. Knowledge of
appropriate use of this technology is essential to any coder. Therefore, since students of
this course should have attained a significant level of maturity and independence, use of
generative AI will be introduced, practice, and (ultimately" expected. Expectations on a
per-assignment basis will be give regarding the usage of AI. Please [contact the instructor](mailto:jhammer@friendsbalt.org) 
with any questions or concerns.
