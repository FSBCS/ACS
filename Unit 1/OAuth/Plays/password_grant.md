**[Scene opens with Alex sitting at the computer.]**

**Narrator:** Alex, a keen photographer, has thousands of pictures stored in his Schmoogle Apps account. Today, he discovers QuickPicApp, a third-party application promising advanced photo editing features.

**Alex:** (excitedly) This QuickPicApp looks amazing for my photo editing! It says it only needs access to my photos. Perfect!

**[QuickPicApp appears on the screen, a sleek and inviting interface.]**

**QuickPicApp:** Hi Alex! I just need your Schmoogle account password to access your photos. I promise, it’s just for the photos!

**Alex:** (typing in his password) Well, I guess that's okay.

**[Scene transitions to a representation of the Schmoogle Server, with Alex’s password arriving.]**

**Schmoogle Server:** (voiceover) Password received. Access granted to all of Alex’s data.

**[Cut back to Alex, who continues browsing other sites, unaware.]**

**Narrator:** But QuickPicApp had other plans. It began sifting through Alex’s emails, documents, and private information.

**[QuickPicApp is shown gleefully scanning through various data types, not just photos.]**

**QuickPicApp:** (sinisterly) So much data! Let’s send this over to our secret buyer. Sorry, Alex!

**[Scene shows data packets flying off to a shadowy figure labeled "Vladimir Putin."]**

**Narrator:** Alex’s data, including sensitive information, was sold to the highest bidder. Weeks later, Alex finds out.

**[Alex is shown reading a shocking news article about the data breach.]**

**Alex:** (distraught) My personal data... Sold? How could this happen! I trusted them!

**Narrator:** And so, Alex learned the hard way about the dangers of sharing passwords with third-party applications.

**[The stage darkens, leaving Alex in a spotlight with a sad expression.]**

**Narrator:** In the digital world, one can never be too cautious. Remember, protect your data as you would protect your home.

**[The light fades out, ending the play.]**
