The following is a list of vocabulary terms that are used in the OAuth 2.0 framework. Understanding these terms is essential for grasping the concepts and mechanics of OAuth 2.0.

## Roles:

- **Resource Owner:** The individual or entity that ultimately owns the data being accessed through OAuth 2.0. This could be a person using a social media platform, a company managing its employees' data, or any other entity that controls access to the data.

- **Resource Server:** The server where the resource owner's data resides. It hosts the protected resources and validates access tokens presented by the client. It doesn't perform user authentication itself.

- **Authorization Server:** The central authority responsible for issuing access tokens. It verifies the legitimacy of the client's request and obtains consent from the resource owner (if required) before granting access.

- **Client:** The application or service requesting access to the resource owner's data on behalf of the user. It initiates the OAuth flow, interacts with the authorization server, and ultimately uses the access token to interact with the resource server.

- **User Agent:** The software application used by the resource owner to interact with the client. This can be a web browser, mobile app, or any other software capable of handling OAuth flows and presenting authorization options to the user.

- **3rd-Party Application:** An application developed and operated by an entity different from the entity that controls the authorization server and resource server. These applications require explicit user consent to access and utilize the resource owner's data. Examples include social media login buttons, third-party data aggregators, or external applications integrating with a company's API.

- **First-Party Application:** An application developed and operated by the same entity that controls the authorization server and resource server. These applications typically enjoy higher trust and might not require explicit user consent for every access since the user already understands they are interacting with the same entity (e.g., a bank accessing its own mobile app or a company's internal tool accessing company data).

## OAuth Grant Types:

1. **Password Grant:**
   - *Definition:* Employs the resource owner's username and password for authorization. Considered less secure due to credential exposure and not recommended for most use cases.
   - *Suitable for:* Server-to-server communication within trusted environments.

2. **Implicit Grant:**
   - *Definition:* Returns the access token directly to the client within the browser, simplifying the flow but raising security concerns due to token exposure in the URL.
   - *Suitable for:* Single-page applications (SPAs) with limited client-side security options.

3. **Authorization Code Flow:**
   - *Definition:* Utilizes an authorization code exchanged for an access token at a separate token endpoint, enhancing security compared to Implicit Grant.
   - *Suitable for:* Web applications, mobile apps, and desktop applications offering a secure and flexible authorization mechanism.

4. **Device Flow:**
   - *Definition:* Allows user authorization on a separate device without a traditional web browser, catering to scenarios like smart TVs or IoT devices.
   - *Suitable for:* Devices with limited input capabilities or lacking web browsers.

5. **Client Credentials Grant:**
   - *Definition:* Enables server-to-server authorization without user involvement, suitable for specific use cases where trust between applications is established.
   - *Suitable for:* Machine-to-machine communication within trusted environments.

Additional Notes:

- **Refresh Tokens:** Issued alongside access tokens, allowing renewal of expired access tokens without requiring user re-authorization.
- **Grant Type:** Specifies the method used to obtain an access token (e.g., Password Grant, Authorization Code Grant).
- **Security Considerations:** Choose the flow based on your application's security requirements and the sensitivity of the accessed data.

## OAuth 2.0 Key Roles and Applications

This document defines key roles and applications involved in OAuth 2.0 flows:

### Roles:

* **Resource Owner:** The individual or entity ultimately owning the data being accessed. (e.g., a social media user, a company with internal data)
* **Resource Server:** The server hosting the protected resources and validating access tokens. (e.g., a social media platform's data servers, a company's internal data storage)
* **Authorization Server:** The central authority issuing access tokens, verifying client requests, and obtaining user consent (if required). (e.g., a social media login service, a company's authentication server)
* **Client:** The application requesting access to resources on behalf of the user. Initiates the flow, interacts with the authorization server, and uses the access token to access resources. (e.g., a social media app, a mobile app integrating with a company's API)
* **OAuth Tenant:** (Optional) Represents a specific organization or domain within the OAuth system, allowing for granular control of access policies and resource sharing.
* **User Agent:** The software application used by the resource owner to interact with the client. (e.g., a web browser, a mobile app)

### Application Types:

* **3rd-Party Application:** Developed and operated by an entity different from the authorization and resource server owner. Requires explicit user consent for access. (e.g., social media login buttons, external data aggregators)
* **First-Party Application:** Developed and operated by the same entity owning the authorization and resource server. May not require explicit user consent for every access due to inherent trust. (e.g., a company's mobile app accessing its own data, internal tools accessing company data)

## OAuth 2.0 Flow Definitions:

This section explores various OAuth 2.0 flow types and their functionalities:

### Flow Types:

**1. Password Grant:**

* **Definition:** Employs the resource owner's username and password for authorization. Considered less secure due to credential exposure and not recommended for most use cases.
* **Suitable for:** Server-to-server communication within trusted environments.

**2. Implicit Grant:**

* **Definition:** Returns the access token directly to the client within the browser, simplifying the flow but raising security concerns due to token exposure in the URL.
* **Suitable for:** Single-page applications (SPAs) with limited client-side security options.

**3. Authorization Code Flow:**

* **Definition:** Utilizes an authorization code exchanged for an access token at a separate token endpoint, enhancing security compared to Implicit Grant.
* **Suitable for:** Web applications, mobile apps, and desktop applications offering a secure and flexible authorization mechanism.

**4. Device Flow:**

* Allows user authorization on a separate device without a traditional web browser, catering to scenarios like smart TVs or IoT devices.
* **Suitable for:** Devices with limited input capabilities or lacking web browsers.
* **Additional Vocabulary:**
    * **Device:** The physical device requiring authorization.
    * **User Code:** A short, human-readable code displayed on the device for verification.
    * **Verification URI:** A URL containing the user code, used to initiate authorization.
    * **Confirmation Screen:** The user interface presented on the web browser device for confirmation.


**5. Client Credentials Grant:**

* **Definition:** Enables server-to-server authorization without user involvement, suitable for specific use cases where trust between applications is established.
* **Suitable for:** Machine-to-machine communication within trusted environments.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Refresh Tokens:** Issued alongside access tokens, allowing renewal of expired access tokens without requiring user re-authorization.
* **Grant Type:** Specifies the method used to obtain an access token (e.g., Password Grant, Authorization Code Grant).
* **Security Considerations:** Choose the flow based on your application's security requirements and the sensitivity of the accessed data.

Remember, this is a brief overview. Specific implementations might have additional nuances and security considerations.


## OAuth 2.0 Token Definitions:

This section dives into the different types of tokens used in OAuth 2.0 flows:

### Tokens:

* **Access Token:**
    * **Definition:** A short-lived, opaque string granting temporary access to specific resources based on the granted scope. It doesn't contain user information and should be transmitted securely (e.g., via HTTPS).
    * **Purpose:** Used by the client to interact with the resource server and access authorized resources.
* **Refresh Token:**
    * **Definition:** A longer-lived token used to obtain new access tokens after the current one expires, avoiding the need for constant user re-authorization. It should be stored securely due to its sensitive nature.
    * **Purpose:** Renews expiring access tokens without requiring user interaction again.
* **Authorization Code:**
    * **Definition:** A temporary code issued by the authorization server in the Authorization Code Flow. It's exchanged for an access token at


## Additional OAuth 2.0 Definitions:

**Front Channel & Back Channel:**

* **Front Channel:** Refers to communication channels that are accessible to the user agent (e.g., web browser, mobile app). Usually this means including information directly in the URL.

* **Back Channel:** Refers to communication channels that are not directly accessible to the user agent. It's used for secure, server-to-server communication, such as token exchange between the client and the authorization server.

**Client ID & Secret:**

* **Definition:**
    * **Client ID:** A public identifier for the client application, registered with the authorization server.
    * **Client Secret:** A confidential piece of information shared only between the client and authorization server, used for authentication and verification.
* **Purpose:** Ensure application legitimacy and prevent unauthorized access.

**Redirect URI & Callback URI:**

* **Definition:** Both terms often refer to the same concept - the URL where the user is redirected after completing the authorization process. This URL receives an authorization code or access token depending on the flow used.
* **Purpose:** Return the user to the client application after authorization and securely communicate authorization results.

**Endpoints:**

* **Authorization Endpoint:** Where the user interacts with the authorization server to grant or deny access to the client.
* **Token Endpoint:** Where the client uses the authorization code (or other grant) to request an access token.
* **Resource Endpoint:** Where the client uses the access token to access protected resources on the resource server.
* **Purpose:** Each endpoint serves a distinct role in the authorization and resource access process.

**Authorization Request & Access Token Request:**

* **Definition:**
    * **Authorization Request:** Contains information sent to the authorization endpoint, typically including client ID, redirect URI, scope, and other relevant parameters.
    * **Access Token Request:** Contains information sent to the token endpoint, including client ID, client secret (depending on flow), and authorization code (or other grant type).
* **Purpose:** Convey necessary information for authorization and access token retrieval.

**Grant Type:**

* **Definition:** Specifies the method used by the client to obtain an access token (e.g., Password Grant, Authorization Code Grant, Client Credentials Grant).
* **Purpose:** Determines the authorization flow and security measures employed.

**OpenID Connect (OIDC):**

* **Definition:** An extension to OAuth 2.0, providing standardized access to user identity information through tokens.
* **Purpose:** Simplifies user authentication and profile retrieval, enhancing user experience and reducing development complexity.

**JWT (JSON Web Token):**

* **Definition:** A self-contained token format carrying information (claims) encoded in JSON and digitally signed/encrypted.
* **Purpose:** Provides a compact and secure way to represent authorization information, often used for access tokens in OIDC implementations.
