# Unit 1: HTTP and OAuth 2.0
In this unit, we will examine how data is exchanged between machines over the internet.
We'll begin with a broad overview of internet protocols and then examine the functions
and conventions of HTTP requests. In the second part of the unit, we'll discuss how to
use OAuth flows to identify users and access data securly within our own web applications.
